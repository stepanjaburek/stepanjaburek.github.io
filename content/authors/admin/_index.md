Hi! My name is Štěpán Jabůrek. I am a PhD student at the Institute of Political Studies at Charles University in Prague and a researcher within Horizon ENSURED.
My substantive research revolves mainly around international cooperation, party politics, and generally the intersection of domestic and international politics. Methodologically, I am interested in natural language processing and statistics in political research.
